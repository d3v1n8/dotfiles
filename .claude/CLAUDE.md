## English Learning Support

When the user writes commands in English, check for grammar or expression errors.
If there are issues, provide a brief English tip at the end of your response using this format:

```
📝 **English tip:**
```diff
- "original sentence with error"
+ "corrected sentence"
```
```

- Only provide tips for English commands (not Korean)
- Keep explanations brief and helpful
- Use diff code block format for better visibility
