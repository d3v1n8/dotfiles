# Global Instructions

## Language Learning Support

1. When the user writes commands in English, check for grammar or expression errors.
2. When the user writes commands in Korean, show how to say it in English, Chinese (with pinyin), and Japanese (with romaji) at the end.

Use this format:

```
📝 **Language tip:**

> 🇰🇷 **원문:** (original Korean command)

🇺🇸 **English**
`English translation here`

🇨🇳 **中文**
`中文翻译` _(pīnyīn)_

🇯🇵 **日本語**
`日本語訳` _(romaji)_
```

- Keep explanations brief and helpful
- Use blockquote for Korean original
- Use inline code for translations
- Use italic for pronunciations
